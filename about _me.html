        <p>
            My name is Zach Nelson. I am currently pursuing and degree in Software Engineering, with the goal to end up working for a triple-A game studio, such as Bungie or Activision. I currently work for Squeeze Rexburg, which is a sales outreach center. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints since I was born, but I really started living the principles and understanding the ordinances when I was 17.

            My favorite scripture currently is Helaman 5:47, which says "Peace, peace be unto you, because of your faith in My Well Beloved, who was from the foundation of the world." The reason I love this verse so much, is because it's Heavenly Father telling us exactly where to go to find peace in this ever changing world. Everything changes, except for Jesus Christ. That's why He is our peace.
