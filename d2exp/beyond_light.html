            My favorite Destiny 2 expansion of all time is Beyond Light. This came out November 10, 2020, and it changed the way the game was played forever. Typically, you use Light-based powers, but Beyond Light tells the story of how you, the Guardian, steal power from the Darkness to aid you in your quest. The Darkness has been your enemy since day one, and now you use the very thing you’ve sworn to destroy. As you grow more powerful with the Darkness, other Guardians struggle to accept this new tool. The Darkness allows you a new subclass, Stasis. Stasis is all about area control, and introduced a new layer of build-crafting with Aspects and Fragments. These new tools allowed you to customize your Guardian like never before, and set the trend for how subclass trees would be built in the game from then on. The end-game activity for this expansion is a raid called “Deep Stone Crypt”. This is my absolute favorite raid in the game. To start off, the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. I’ll include a link to my favorite song, Deep Stone Lullaby. This raid is packed full of new mechanics to learn, intense boss fights, and some of the most unique weapons in the game. From a chainsaw sword with some of the highest DPS in the game, to weapon perks that refill and overflow your magazines, to weapons that revolutionize the way PvE content is done, the Deep Stone Crypt loot pool brought everything we thought we knew about strategy to a screeching halt. There is so much to say about Beyond Light, but just know that some of the best memories I have in Destiny 2 happened because of this expansion.
