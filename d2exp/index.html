    <h2>Brief Overview of D2</h2>
    <p>
        Destiny 2 is a first-person, looter shooter, MMO game. Created by Bungie as a sequel to the widely successful Destiny, Destiny 2 was released in late 2017 to a mediocre response from players. Since then, multiple improvements have been made to the game, transforming a once lacking gaming experience, to some of the best experiences FPS games have to offer. From fast paced PvP matches, to complicated PvE puzzles, open world activities, and intense end-game content, coupled alongside deep lore complex build-crafting, Destiny 2 has something for every player to enjoy. With so much content, it can be hard to know where to start. This website will show you where to begin, along with some of my favorite expansions to provide you with an engaging experience every time you load in.

    <h3>Basic Lore</h3>

    <p>
        You are a Guardian, defender of the Last City. You wield the Light, mystical powers given to you by a giant moon orbiting Earth, fighting off aliens who want your powers for themselves. There are many races of aliens, each with their own schemes for the Light, and each with their own type of magic. As you defeat the alien races, along with their gods, you grow stronger, and are able to forge new weapons with alien magic to aid you in your fight.

        Destiny 2 does a fairly good job explaining what the game is and how to play it right from the get go. The “New Light” campaign teaches you most everything you need to know about Destiny 2, and there are only a few things I would add. One, follow your guardian rank steps closely. This is handcrafted to teach you everything important about Destiny 2, but the game doesn’t explicitly say that. Two, if you want in depth guides on builds, artifact and armor mods, or secrets, there are not many resources in game to teach you. Some of my favorite ways to learn about these things are through a Youtuber named Datto. His channel will be linked here.
