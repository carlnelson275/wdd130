        Brief Overview of D2

	Destiny 2 is a first-person, looter shooter, MMO game. Created by Bungie as a sequel to the widely successful Destiny, Destiny 2 was released in late 2017 to a mediocre response from players. Since then, multiple improvements have been made to the game, transforming a once lacking gaming experience, to some of the best experiences FPS games have to offer. From fast paced PvP matches, to complicated PvE puzzles, open world activities, and intense end-game content, coupled alongside deep lore complex build-crafting, Destiny 2 has something for every player to enjoy. With so much content, it can be hard to know where to start. This website will show you where to begin, along with some of my favorite expansions to provide you with an engaging experience every time you load in. 

Basic Lore
	You are a Guardian, defender of the Last City. You wield the Light, mystical powers given to you by a giant moon orbiting Earth, fighting off aliens who want your powers for themselves. There are many races of aliens, each with their own schemes for the Light, and each with their own type of magic. As you defeat the alien races, along with their gods, you grow stronger, and are able to forge new weapons with alien magic to aid you in your fight. 

Base Game
	Destiny 2 does a fairly good job explaining what the game is and how to play it right from the get go. The “New Light” campaign teaches you most everything you need to know about Destiny 2, and there are only a few things I would add. One, follow your guardian rank steps closely. This is handcrafted to teach you everything important about Destiny 2, but the game doesn’t explicitly say that. Two, if you want in depth guides on builds, artifact and armor mods, or secrets, there are not many resources in game to teach you. Some of my favorite ways to learn about these things are through a Youtuber named Datto. His channel will be linked here.

      <h3>Beyond Light</h3>
      <p>
        My favorite Destiny 2 expansion of all time is Beyond Light. This came out November 10, 2020, and it changed the way the game was played forever. Typically, you use Light-based powers, but Beyond Light tells the story of how you, the Guardian, steal power from the Darkness to aid you in your quest. The Darkness has been your enemy since day one, and now you use the very thing you’ve sworn to destroy. As you grow more powerful with the Darkness, other Guardians struggle to accept this new tool. The Darkness allows you a new subclass, Stasis. Stasis is all about area control, and introduced a new layer of build-crafting with Aspects and Fragments. These new tools allowed you to customize your Guardian like never before, and set the trend for how subclass trees would be built in the game from then on. The end-game activity for this expansion is a raid called “Deep Stone Crypt”. This is my absolute favorite raid in the game. To start off, the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. I’ll include a link to my favorite song, Deep Stone Lullaby. This raid is packed full of new mechanics to learn, intense boss fights, and some of the most unique weapons in the game. From a chainsaw sword with some of the highest DPS in the game, to weapon perks that refill and overflow your magazines, to weapons that revolutionize the way PvE content is done, the Deep Stone Crypt loot pool brought everything we thought we knew about strategy to a screeching halt. There is so much to say about Beyond Light, but just know that some of the best memories I have in Destiny 2 happened because of this expansion.

      <h3>Forsaken</h3>
      <p>
        My second favorite expansion for Destiny 2 is Forsaken. Released on September 4 2018, this expansion focuses on the death of the beloved Cayde-6. Cayde was part of the Vanguard, the lead strike force of the Guardians. He was killed by a rogue Guardian named Uldren Sov, who was working with an evil alien race called the Scorn. The campaign focuses on getting revenge for Cayde’s death, where you hunt down each of the 8 leaders of the Scorn. From Forsaken come some of my favorite weapons in all of Destiny 2. I still use the Ace of Spades hand cannon, the Thorn hand cannon, the Anarchy grenade launcher, and the Le Monarque bow from the expansion on the regular, and they remain top tier options for most content. This expansion also included two end-game activities, the Last Wish raid, and the Shattered Throne dungeon. Both Last Wish and Shattered Throne are easily some of the best in their respective categories, with high difficulty, great loot, and very unique mechanics. All in all, Forsaken gave us some of the best content ever in Destiny 2, and will go down in history as a truly incredible addition to the best video game out there.
