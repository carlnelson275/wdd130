            My second favorite expansion for Destiny 2 is Forsaken. Released on September 4 2018, this expansion focuses on the death of the beloved Cayde-6. Cayde was part of the Vanguard, the lead strike force of the Guardians. He was killed by a rogue Guardian named Uldren Sov, who was working with an evil alien race called the Scorn. The campaign focuses on getting revenge for Caydeâ€™s death, where you hunt down each of the 8 leaders of the Scorn. From Forsaken come some of my favorite weapons in all of Destiny 2. I still use the Ace of Spades hand cannon, the Thorn hand cannon, the Anarchy grenade launcher, and the Le Monarque bow from the expansion on the regular, and they remain top tier options for most content. This expansion also included two end-game activities, the Last Wish raid, and the Shattered Throne dungeon. Both Last Wish and Shattered Throne are easily some of the best in their respective categories, with high difficulty, great loot, and very unique mechanics. At left is pictured the final boss of the Last Wish Raid, Riven the Ahamkhara, and a still of the Shattered Thron Dungeon. All in all, Forsaken gave us some of the best content ever in Destiny 2, and will go down in history as a truly incredible addition to the best video game out there.
